referral_text: |
  Thank you for seeing this patient who has recently attended the surgery with a 1-month history of
  nausea and anorexia.
  I have found no abnormalities on examination but her routine blood tests
  show a gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 252 U/L (normal range: 4-35) and an alanine
  aminotransferase (ALT) of 75 U/L (normal range: 5-35).
  She is not taking any prescribed medication.

  The patient has a past history of depression and is the mother of two teenaged children.
  On examination, she seemed very anxious.
