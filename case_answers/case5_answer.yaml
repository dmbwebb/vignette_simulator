diagnosis:
  correct:
    - Asthma
    - asthma attack
  not_incorrect_but_insufficient:
    - Reactive Airway Disease # Neither of these are accepted diagnostic labels, rather are descriptive. RADS tends to refer to a patient with an ‘acute asthma-like’ attack but with no previous history of asthma (which this patient’s history suggests he has had)
    - Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome # Neither of these are accepted diagnostic labels, rather are descriptive. RADS tends to refer to a patient with an ‘acute asthma-like’ attack but with no previous history of asthma (which this patient’s history suggests he has had)
    - Dust-Induced Airway Hyperreactivity # he says dust makes things worse, but again, it’s not a ‘diagnosis’
    - exercise-induced bronchoconstriction # Not sufficient for diagnosis, more describing symptoms
  incorrect:
    - allergic bronchospasm # a confusing term in this case as he doesn’t admit to any allergies
    - bronchitis # the moment the term ‘bronchitis’ is used, there is a danger that it will be considered to be an infection-related condition, or an infectious condition, and antibiotics might be given; so this term should definitely not be used
    - blood pressure problem
    - gastrointestinal problem
    - heart problem
    - the weather
    - cough in chest
    - thyroid problem
    - weakness
    - lack of blood
    - infection in windpipe
    - pregnancy
    - allergy

treatments:
  correct:
    - bronchodilators
    - theophylline
    - inhaled or oral corticosteroids
    - Budesonide # example of inhaled corticosteroid
    - leukotriene inhibitors
    - cromones
    - inhaled anticholinergics
    - beta-agonists 
    - Prednisolone
    - peak-flow test # straightforward and should be done in all patients with suspected or definite asthma - easy to use and should be used in ‘primary care’
  palliative:
    - anti‑allergy medication
    - referral to a lung function test (spirometry) # more complicated than peak flow tests - needs more sophisticated testing equipment and more specialist knowledge / skills to interpret the results - not to be used in ‘primary care’
    - wearing a mask # unlikely to help unless ‘dust’ identified as a major or unique precipitator of symptoms
    - environmental control # should always be explored in the history, and advice given re ‘avoidance’ and / or measures to reduce exposure to common and/or patient specific precipitants; in practice, rarely makes a clinical significant difference as ‘control measures’ are difficult to implement, and most patients have multiple precipitating factors
    - avoidance of known triggers # see above
    - avoid triggers like dust, smoke, etc. # see above
    - Oxygen therapy
  neutral:
    - monitoring
