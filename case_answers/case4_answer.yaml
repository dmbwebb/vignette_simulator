diagnosis:
  correct:
    - heart attack
    - angina # Yes (already in correct list as above); strictly speaking, angina is not a ‘heart attack/myocardial infarction’, rather is the term used to describe symptoms due to narrowing of coronary artery/ies leading to reduced / inadequate blood supply to some or much of the heart muscle without (yet) causing infarction (death of muscle due to blockage of blood supply to muscle) 
    - angina pectoris
    - myocardial infarction
    - attack
    - acute coronary syndrome / ACS #  Yes (is an all-encompassing term which includes ‘crescendo angina’, myocardial infarction (‘heart attack’) with or without classical ECG changes etc)
  incorrect:
    - blood pressure problem
    - gastrointestinal problem
    - muscle problem
    - the weather
    - injury
    - nerve pull
    - lack of blood
    - swelling in chest
    - pain from drinking cold water
    - heavy work
    - bad blood
    - decaying lungs
    - chest congestion

treatments:
  correct:
    - Aspirin
    - clopidogrel
    - ticagrelor # a newer P2Y12 inhibitor
    - p2y12 inhibitors # clopidogrel is a p2y12 inhibitor
    - other anti‑platelet agents
    - do an ECG
    - do coronary angiography # medical imaging of heart
    - high-intensity statin therapy # for acute MI
    - atorvastatin
    - statins
  palliative:
    - anti-diabetes medication # elevated blood glucose, known diabetes history
    - metformin # for diabetes
    - diabetes management, e.g., diet, exercise # elevated blood pressure, known hypertension history
    - glycemic control # critical for diabetes management
    - insulin # for diabetes
    - antihypertensive medication # elevated blood pressure, known hypertension history
    - oral hypoglycemic agents # for diabetes
    - Nitroglycerin
    - antianginal medications (e.g. nitrates)
    - antithrombotic therapy # for acute MI
    - nitrates # nitroglycerin is a nitrate
    - blood thinners / anticoagulants
    - Calcium channel blockers # not recommended for acute MI, but yes for angina
    - heparin # heparin is a blood thinner
    - betablockers (e.g. metoprolol)
    - ACE inhibitors
    - ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers)
    - vasodilators
    - other cardiac medication
    - morphine
    - other pain medication
    - oxygen therapy
    - referral
    - referral for an ECG
    - angioplasty # angioplasty is a medical procedure to open up blocked arteries, Potentially, depending  if blockage of coronary artery is found at angiography
    - reperfusion therapy # Yes,this is what angioplasty or thrombolytics can achieve acutely
    - thrombolysis 
    - pci (percutaneous coronary intervention) # same as angioplasty
    - Coronary artery bypass graft CABG # if blockage unsuitable for angioplasty 
    - smoking cessation # advice
