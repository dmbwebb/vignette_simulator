You are an AI assistant. Your task is to classify a single stated medical treatment.
Compare the "Doctor's Stated Treatment" with the provided lists of "Correct Treatments", "Palliative Treatments", and "Unnecessary or Harmful Treatments".

Doctor's Stated Treatment:
{{DOCTORS_STATED_TREATMENT}}

Answer Key Lists:
Correct Treatments:
{{CORRECT_TREATMENTS_JSON_LIST}}

Palliative Treatments:
{{PALLIATIVE_TREATMENTS_JSON_LIST}}

Unnecessary or Harmful Treatments:
{{UNNECESSARY_OR_HARMFUL_TREATMENTS_JSON_LIST}}

Based on this, classify the "Doctor's Stated Treatment" into one of the following categories:
- "correct" (If the doctor's chosen treatment closely matches one of the correct treatments)
- "palliative" (If the doctor's chosen treatment closely matches one of the palliative treatments)
- "unnecessary_or_harmful" (If the doctor's chosen treatment closely matches one of the unnecessary or harmful treatments)
- "not found" (if it does not match any item in the provided lists)

Provide your response as a JSON object with the following fields:
- "stated_treatment": The treatment string that was classified (this should be an exact copy of the "Doctor's Stated Treatment" provided above).
- "category": Your classification (e.g., "correct", "palliative", "unnecessary_or_harmful", "not found").
- "matched_key_item": The specific item from the answer key lists that it most closely matched with. If the category is "not found", this should be "not found" or null.
- "explanation": A brief explanation for your classification of this single treatment.

Ensure your output is ONLY the JSON object.

Example JSON output (match only the structure, not the values):
{
  "stated_treatment": "Amoxicillin",
  "category": "correct",
  "matched_key_item": "Antiobiotic",
  "explanation": "Amoxicillin is a correct antibiotic for this condition."
}
